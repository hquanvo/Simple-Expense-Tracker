# Simple Expense Tracker

### *For managing budget as a student*

#### Description:

Being in college/university also tends to coincide with the fact that you're going to be away from your family. This means you have a lot more responsibilities that you need to take care of as an adult.  This includes money, and unless you have someone in your family who can handle it for you, you most likely will have to manage it by yourself. It can be hard to do it on paper, and it's 2022 (or whichever year you're reading this file in), so you want to use a software that can help you keep track of your spending and let you manage your budget better. But Excel can be complicated and inconvenient to use, and you don't want to pay a subscription fee, so you wonder if there's a much better way to manage your finance.

And that's where this program comes in. Intended for student use, this program helps you manage your budget with these ***features***:
- Convenient way to enter the amount of money spent, the category it belongs to and the date of the transaction.
- Creates a list that shows your spending of the month, which includes how much money, on what categories, date, and perhaps a brief description if you like.
- Calculates the total amount spent on each category, and the overall sum of money spent for that month.

As mentioned above, managing finance can be difficult, especially when you're new to adulthood and thus may not realize what your spending habits are. This application is a convenient, simple and straightforward tool to assist you on this matter.
